bancr ![](reference/figures/logo.png) ===========

The **bancr** package provides R access to the first unified
brain-and-nerve-cord connectome of a limbed animal - the Brain And Nerve
Cord dataset (*BANC*) of *Drosophila melanogaster*. This important
dataset represents a significant advance in our understanding of neural
circuits, revealing how the brain and nerve cord work together as an
integrated system to control behavior.

### Scientific Significance

The BANC connectome is the first complete connectome to include both
brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) of a limbed animal, comprising
approximately 160,000 neurons across the entire central nervous system.
This unprecedented scope reveals:

- **Distributed control architecture**: Motor control involves both
  brain circuits and local VNC networks working in parallel
- **Local feedback loops**: VNC circuits can modulate sensory
  information before it reaches the brain
- **Behaviour-centric neural modules**: Functionally related circuits
  are organised across brain-VNC boundaries
- **Descending and ascending pathways**: Complete characterization of
  information flow between brain and nerve cord

### Key Features

- **Complete connectivity**: Full synaptic resolution across brain and
  VNC
- **Cell type annotations**: Comprehensive cell type classification
  system
- **Rich metadata**: Extensive annotations including neurotransmitter
  predictions
- **Research-ready tools**: Streamlined access to connectome data and
  analysis functions

### Research Applications

This dataset enables important research into: - **Sensorimotor
integration**: How sensory information is processed and translated into
motor commands - **Distributed neural computation**: How the brain and
nerve cord share computational load - **Behavioural circuit analysis**:
Mapping complete neural pathways underlying specific behaviours -
**Comparative connectomics**: Understanding how nervous system
organisation relates to behavioural complexity

## Getting BANC meta data

For nearly all users, the recommended way to get BANC neuron metadata is
the **public compiled meta feather** that ships in the lee-lab GCS
bucket:

    gs://lee-lab_brain-and-nerve-cord-fly-connectome/compiled_data/banc_888/banc_888_meta.feather

That one file (~55 MB) is a harmonised per-neuron table of ~188 k rows ×
75 columns — root IDs, soma side, the full BANC annotation hierarchy
(`flow` / `super_class` / `cell_class` / `cell_sub_class` /
`cell_type`), cross-dataset matches (`fafb_*`, `manc_*`, `hemibrain_*`,
`malecns_*`, `fanc_*`), neurotransmitter predictions, hemilineage,
neuropil membership and more. Schema details are in the [dataset
documentation](https://github.com/sjcabs/fly_connectome_data_tutorial/tree/main/data/dataset_documentation).

`bancr` wraps it for you:

``` r

library(bancr)

# Download (one-time, cached) and load the compiled meta feather.
# No CAVE / SeaTable authentication is needed for this path.
banc_meta_create_cache()        # source = "gcs" is the default

# Quick lookups against the in-memory cache
all_meta   <- banc_meta()
dna02_meta <- banc_meta(ids = "/type:DNa02")
```

The
[`banc_meta()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banc_meta.md)
accessor returns the 6 canonical columns used by
[coconatfly](https://natverse.org/coconatfly/) (`id`, `class`, `type`,
`side`, `subclass`, `subsubclass`). To work with the full 75-column
feather directly, point
[`arrow::read_feather()`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/read_feather.html)
at the URL above.

Two alternative sources are available for advanced users:

- `banc_meta_create_cache(source = "cave")` — live read from
  [`banc_cell_info()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banc_cave_tables.md) +
  [`banc_codex_annotations()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banc_codex_annotations.md)
  (needs BANC CAVE access). Use this when you need labels fresher than
  the latest GCS snapshot.
- `banc_meta_create_cache(source = "seatable")` — pulls the draft
  `banc_meta` SeaTable. **BANC production team only.** All other
  `banctable_*` functions in this package sit behind the same
  authenticated SeaTable and are not relevant to the general user; they
  exist to support the small group of people producing BANC annotations.

[`franken_meta()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banctable_query.md)
follows the same convention: by default it reads the public per-dataset
feathers (`compiled_data/fafb_783/fafb_783_meta.feather`,
`compiled_data/manc_121/manc_121_meta.feather`, etc.), column-unions
them, and never touches SeaTable.

## Quick Start Examples

Here’s how to get started with analyzing descending neurons (DNs) that
connect brain to nerve cord in the fly connectome:

``` r

library(bancr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Get all BANC cell type annotations
annotations <- banc_codex_annotations()

# Focus on DNa02 descending neurons
dna02_neurons <- annotations %>%
  filter(cell_type == "DNa02")

# Extract their root IDs
dna02_ids <- dna02_neurons$pt_root_id

# Get connectivity data for these neurons
## This is a large download, may take ~10-20 mins
el <- banc_edgelist()

# Subset connectivity by our neurons of interest
dna02_connections <- el %>%
  filter(pre_pt_root_id %in% dna02_ids)

# Visualize connection strength distribution
ggplot(dna02_connections, aes(x = n)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.7, color = "black", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Connection Strength Distribution for DNa02 Neurons",
       x = "Number of Synapses",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Annotation Systems

The BANC dataset provides two complementary annotation systems for
neuron classification:

### Centralised Annotations

**[`banc_codex_annotations()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banc_codex_annotations.md)**
provides access to standardised cell type annotations curated by the
BANC core team. These official classifications are: - Displayed on
[FlyWireCodex](https://codex.flywire.ai/?dataset=banc) - Standardised
and consistent across the dataset - Serve as the authoritative reference
for BANC cell types - Ideal for comparative studies and standardised
analyses

### Community Annotations

**[`banc_cell_info()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/banc_cave_tables.md)**
accesses non-centralised annotations from the broader research
community. These annotations: - Represent diverse contributions from
researchers studying specific circuits - Provide specialized knowledge
about particular cell types - Offer detailed insights from domain
experts - Complement the standardised classifications with
research-specific perspectives

Both systems work together to provide comprehensive neuron
characterisation, combining standardised reference classifications with
specialised research insights.

## BANC Metadata

The BANC connectome uses a comprehensive controlled vocabulary and
annotation taxonomy to ensure consistent classification across all
~160,000 neurons. This standardised system enables systematic analysis
of neural circuits and facilitates data integration across research
groups.

### Annotation Hierarchy

The BANC annotation system employs a hierarchical classification
structure:

| Level | Description | Examples | Count |
|----|----|----|----|
| **flow** | CNS-wide perspective | `afferent`, `efferent`, `intrinsic` | 3 |
| **super_class** | Coarse functional division | `ascending`, `descending`, `motor`, `sensory` | 13 |
| **cell_class** | Anatomical/functional types | `olfactory_receptor_neuron`, `antennal_lobe_projection_neuron` | 106 |
| **cell_sub_class** | Specific neural subtypes | `antenna_olfactory_receptor_neuron`, `multiglomerular_projection_neuron` | 176 |
| **cell_type** | Individual neuron names | `ORN_DM6`, `ORN_VA1v`, `DNge110` | many |

### Key Annotation Categories

**Anatomical Properties:** - **region**: CNS region (`brain`,
`central_brain`, `optic_lobe`, `ventral_nerve_cord`,
`neck_connective`) - **side**: Laterality (`L`=left, `R`=right) -
**nerve**: Entry/exit nerve (`left_antennal_nerve`,
`right_mesothoracic_leg_nerve`, etc.)

**Functional Properties:** - **cell_function**: Brief functional
description (`antenna_motor`, `leg_motor`, `anti_diuresis`, etc.) -
**peripheral_target_type**: Target sensor/effector
(`accessory_tibia_flexor_muscle`, `chordotonal_organ`, etc.) -
**body_part_sensory/effector**: Body regions innervated (`abdomen`,
`antenna`, `wing`, etc.)

**Molecular Properties:** - **neurotransmitter_verified**:
Literature-confirmed neurotransmitters from unpublished literature
review
(<https://github.com/funkelab/drosophila_neurotransmitters/tree/main>)
(`acetylcholine`, `dopamine`, `gaba`, `dopamine`, `serotonin`,
`ocotopamine`, `tyramine`, `histamine`, `some negative results`) -
**neurotransmitter_predicted**: CNN-predicted neurotransmitters -
**neuropeptide_verified**: Literature-confirmed neuropeptides (`AstA`,
`CCAP`, `dNPF`, etc.)

**Cross-Dataset Integration:** - **fafb_783_match_id**: Corresponding
FAFB v783 neuron IDs - **manc_121_match_id**: Corresponding MANC v1.2.1
neuron IDs - **hemilineage**: Developmental lineage classification
(`00A`, `ALad1`, `LB7`, etc.)

This systematic annotation framework enables: - **Consistent
terminology** across all BANC analyses - **Hierarchical organisation**
from broad categories to specific cell types - **Cross-dataset
integration** with other *Drosophila* connectomes (FAFB, MANC) -
**Multi-modal characterisation** combining anatomy, function, and
molecular properties

For the complete annotation taxonomy and detailed term descriptions, see
the BANC paper supplementary materials ([Bates et
al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.31.667571)) and the [BANC
community
wiki](https://github.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/wiki/).

## Access and Setup

These data are made available by the *BANC* project led by Wei-Chung
Allen Lee (Harvard) and collaborators including Zetta.ai and the FlyWire
team at Princeton. Anyone can request access to the data
[here](https://flywire.ai/banc_access). Learn more on the [BANC
wiki](https://github.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/wiki/).
After this, you should have a linked Google account that will be
authorised (see below) for access to banc online resources.

Broadly speaking the **bancr** package is largely a wrapper over the
[fafbseg](https://github.com/natverse/fafbseg) package setting up
necessary default paths etc. It is based on another wrapper for a
separate project, [fancr](https://github.com/flyconnectome/fancr).

If you have access, you can view *BANC* data in this helpful
[neuroglancer
scene](https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!middleauth+https://global.daf-apis.com/nglstate/api/v1/4753860997414912).

The BANC project uses [CAVE tables](https://global.daf-apis.com/info/)
to store many sorts of annotation information. You can see the available
CAVE tables for BANC
[here](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/annotation/views/aligned_volume/brain_and_nerve_cord).
CAVE tables can be joined into useful [CAVE
views](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/materialize/views/datastack/brain_and_nerve_cord)
pinned to a materialisation, which can provide very useful objects such
as the whole BANC edgelist. BANC view names and SQL formulas are given
[here](https://github.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/wiki/CAVE-Views).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `bancr` from github:

``` r

remotes::install_github('natverse/bancr')
```

To do anything useful with the bancr package, you need authorisation to
access banc resources - anyone can ask for access
[here](https://flywire.ai/banc_access). To prove your authorisation for
programmatic access you must generate and store a token in your web
browser after logging in to an approved Google account. This should be
streamlined by running the following command in R (which will also set
you up for Pythonic access via cloudvolume).

``` r

# set up token - will open your browser to generate a new token
banc_set_token()


# if you already have one do 
# banc_set_token("<my token>")
```

To check that everything is set up properly, try:

``` r

# diagnose issues
dr_banc()

# confirm functionality, should return FALSE
banc_islatest("720575941562355975")
```

Some functions rely on underlying Python code by [Philipp
Schlegel](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-philip-schlegel),
called using the `reticulate` package. You can install full set of
recommended libraries including `fafbseg-py`:

    fafbseg::simple_python("full")

Note that this package is designed to play nicely with `fafbseg`, which
has been used mainly for the *FAFB-FlyWire* project, but could be used
to work with data from many neuroglancer/CAVE based projects.

If you get an error related to not finding cloud-volume or the
cloud-volume version, the solution may be to update cloud-volume, as so:

``` r

fafbseg::simple_python('none', pkgs='cloud-volume~=8.32.1')
fafbseg::simple_python('none', pkgs='caveclient~=8.0.0')
```

Use
[`with_banc()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/choose_banc.md)
to wrap many additional `fafbseg::flywire_*` functions for use with the
*BANC*. Alternatively
[`choose_banc()`](https://natverse.github.io/bancr/reference/choose_banc.md)
to set all `flywire_*` functions from `fafbseg` to target the *BANC*.
Not all functions will work.

### Updating

You can just repeat the install instructions, but this ensures that all
dependencies are updated:

``` r

remotes::install_github('natverse/bancr')
```

If you need to update a specific Python library dependent, you can do:

``` r

fafbseg::simple_python(pkgs='fafbseg')
```

## Ascending Neuron Vignette

### Load the code we need

First we need to load the package, and direct ourselves to the *BANC*
data set.

``` r

library(bancr)
# choose_banc()
```

### Identify the neurons we care about

Next, let us query a *BANC* CAVE table in order to get the neurons users
have annotated as ‘ascending’ neurons, i.e. neurons that have their cell
bodies and dendrites in the ventral nerve cord, and their axons in the
brain.

``` r

banc.neck.connective.neurons <- banc_neck_connective_neurons()
head(banc.neck.connective.neurons)
```

After considering these neurons, I have decided I would like to plot two
of them. They are both members of the same cell type. They are
identified by a 16-bit `root_id`.

    an1.left <- "720575941566983162"
    an1.right <- "720575941562355975"

This ID changes each time a neuron is edited, so while the *BANC* is an
active project they are unstable. Likely by the time you read this, they
have changed a little, although they describe the same cells.

Therefore, let us make sure we have the most up to date IDs.

    an1.left <- banc_latestid(an1.left)
    an1.right <- banc_latestid(an1.right)
    an1.ids <- c(an1.left, an1.right)
    an1.ids

Sometimes a more stable way to track a neuron (as long as it has a cell
body within the *BANC* volume) is to consider its `nucleus_id`.

We can get a table of nucleus ids from CAVE and find ours. The `root_id`
column in these CAVE tables automatically update.

    banc.nuclei <- banc_nuclei()
    banc.nuclei.an1 <- banc.nuclei[as.character(banc.nuclei$pt_root_id) %in% an1.ids,]
    banc.nuclei.an1.ids <- as.character(banc.nuclei.an1$id)
    banc.nuclei.an1

### Obtain neuron segmentation data

Great. Next, we want to read the mesh objects of our neurons.

``` r

an1.left.mesh <- banc_read_neuron_meshes(an1.left)
an1.right.mesh <- banc_read_neuron_meshes(an1.right)
```

These neurons will be in ‘*BANC* coordinates’, in nanometers. They are
read as `mesh3d` objects which describe triangular meshes.

But we can also get proxy ‘L2’ skeletons from the segmentation graph for
each neuron.

These functions depend on Philipp Schlegel’s `fafbseg-py` library. You
can install this using
[`fafbseg::simple_python`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/fafbseg/man/simple_python.html).
See above.

``` r

an1.left.skel <- banc_read_l2skel(an1.left)
an1.right.skel <- banc_read_l2skel(an1.right)
```

We can also get `mesh3d` objects for our nuclei.

``` r

an1.left.nucleus <- banc_read_nuclei_mesh(banc.nuclei.an1.ids[1])
an1.right.nucleus <- banc_read_nuclei_mesh(banc.nuclei.an1.ids[2])
```

### Plot our *BANC* neurons

We can plot our neurons in 3D using the `rgl` package.

First, we can plot the *BANC* volume mesh which shows all the brain
tissue.

``` r

nopen3d()
banc_view()
plot3d(banc.surf, col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.1)
```

We can also see the synaptic neuropil inside of it.

``` r

plot3d(banc_neuropil.surf, col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.25)
```

And now our neurons, their skeletons and their nuclei.

``` r

# Plot neuron meshes
plot3d(an1.left.mesh, col = "coral", alpha = 0.75)
plot3d(an1.right.mesh, col = "chartreuse", alpha = 0.75)

# Plot neuron skeletons
plot3d(an1.left.skel, col = "darkred", alpha = 1)
plot3d(an1.right.skel, col = "darkgreen", alpha = 1)

# Plot nuclei meshes
plot3d(an1.left.nucleus, col = "black", alpha = 1, add = TRUE)
plot3d(an1.right.nucleus, col = "black", alpha = 1, add = TRUE)
```

![banc_an1](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/banc_an1.png?raw=true)

banc_an1

We can also make a 2D image of multiple views using `ggplot2`.

``` r

# Simplify meshes to  make plotting faster
banc_neuropil <- Rvcg::vcgQEdecim(as.mesh3d(banc_neuropil.surf), percent = 0.1)
banc_brain_neuropil <- Rvcg::vcgQEdecim(as.mesh3d(banc_brain_neuropil.surf), percent = 0.1)
banc_vnc_neuropil <- Rvcg::vcgQEdecim(as.mesh3d(banc_vnc_neuropil.surf), percent = 0.1)
an1.left.mesh.simp <- Rvcg::vcgQEdecim(an1.left.mesh[[1]], percent = 0.1)
an1.right.mesh.simp <- Rvcg::vcgQEdecim(an1.right.mesh[[1]], percent = 0.1)

# Plot! Saves as a PNG file
banc_neuron_comparison_plot(neuron1 = an1.left.mesh.simp,
                           neuron2 = an1.right.mesh.simp,
                           neuron1.info = "AN1_right",
                           neuron2.info = "AN1_left",
                           banc_neuropil = banc_neuropil,
                           banc_brain_neuropil = banc_brain_neuropil,
                           banc_vnc_neuropil = banc_vnc_neuropil,
                           filename = "banc_an_comparison_ggplot2.png?raw=true")

# Tip: You may need to hit 'zoom' on the RStudio plot pane, to see finer meshes,
# when filename = NULL.
```

### Left-right mirror *BANC* neurons

Using a bridge to the symmetric ‘template brain’ (see below), we can
‘mirror’ neurons in *BANC* even though it is an asymmetric space.

Here we can see the normal (grey) and mirrored mesh (green). At the
moment, this works less well in the VNC than the brain.

![banc_neuropil_mirrored](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/banc_neuropil_mirrored.png?raw=true)

banc_neuropil_mirrored

``` r

an1.left.skel.m <- banc_mirror(an1.left.skel, method = "tpsreg")
an1.right.skel.m <- banc_mirror(an1.right.skel, , method = "tpsreg")
```

And now plot the mirrored skeletons, and the non-mirrored meshes for
comparison:

``` r

# Set up 3D plot
nopen3d()
banc_view()
plot3d(banc_neuropil.surf, col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.1)

# Plot native neuron meshes
plot3d(an1.left.mesh, col = "coral", alpha = 0.5)
plot3d(an1.right.mesh, col = "chartreuse", alpha = 0.5)

# Plot mirrored neuron skeletons
plot3d(an1.left.skel.m, col = "darkred", alpha = 1)
plot3d(an1.right.skel.m, col = "darkgreen", alpha = 1)
```

![banc_ans_mirrored](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/banc_ans_mirrored.png?raw=true)

banc_ans_mirrored

We can also change the view to see, for example, the brain more clearly.

``` r

banc_front_view()
```

![banc_ans_mirrored_brain](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/banc_ans_mirrored_brain.png?raw=true)

banc_ans_mirrored_brain

Or the ventral nerve cord.

``` r

banc_vnc_view()
```

### Co-plot *FAFB-FlyWire* and Hemibrain neurons

[Jasper Phelps](https://people.epfl.ch/jasper.phelps/?lang=en) has made
a *BANC*-to-JRC2018F and JRC2018F-to-*BANC* transform using the software
[Elastix](https://elastix.dev/download.php). Therefore, we can use this
transform to move data transformed first into `JRC2018F`, into the
*BANC*. Or data out of the *BANC*, into `JRC2018` and then any other
template brain to which `JRC2018F` can be bridged.

We can either use the Elastix transform directly if you have Elastix
installed on your machine (implemented as `method="elastix"`). This can
be a bit of a journey, so I have also implemented a [thin plate spine
registration](https://rdrr.io/cran/Morpho/man/computeTransform.html)
that is based on the Elastix transform, made and applied using the R
package `Morpho` (implemented as `method="tpsreg"`) . The end result of
the two methods can be very slightly different.

Firstly, let’s just take the brain part of the ANs we have, as
`JRC2018F` only include the brain.

``` r

# Show only the portion in the brain
an1.mesh.simp <- neuronlist(an1.left.mesh.simp, an1.right.mesh.simp)
an1.mesh.simp.brain  <- banc_decapitate(an1.mesh.simp, invert = TRUE)

# Convert to JRC2018F space
an1.mesh.simp.brain.jrc2018f <- banc_to_JRC2018F(an1.mesh.simp.brain,
                                                  method = "tpsreg",
                                                  banc.units = "nm")

# Plot in JRC2018 space
nopen3d()
plot3d(JRC2018F.surf, col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.1)
plot3d(an1.mesh.simp.brain.jrc2018f, col = c("turquoise", "navy"), alpha = 0.75, add = TRUE)
```

![an_banc_jrc2018f](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/an_banc_jrc2018f.png?raw=true)

an_banc_jrc2018f

We can now read a neuron from *FAFB-FlyWire*. I already know the ID of
the comparable *FAFB-FlyWire* neurons to fetch.

We need to load a new R package first.

``` r

if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('natverse/nat.jrcbrains')

library(nat.jrcbrains)

## You may need to download the relevant registration, if you have not already:
# download_saalfeldlab_registrations()
```

And then get known *FAFB-FlyWire* neurons.

``` r

## if you previously ran choose_banc()
## now run: 
# choose_segmentation("flywire31")
# Which directs you towards the active FAFB-FlyWire segmentation

# Define the IDs we wish to fetch
# these are from the 783 materialisation (i.e.) published version
fw.an1.ids <- c("720575940626768442", "720575940636821616")

# Get neuron meshes
fw.an1.meshes <- read_cloudvolume_meshes(fw.an1.ids)

# Convert to JRC2018F
fw.an1.meshes.jrc2018f <- xform_brain(fw.an1.meshes, sample = "FAFB14",
reference = "JRC2018F")

# Add to plot
plot3d(fw.an1.meshes.jrc2018f, col = c("red","orange"), alpha = 1, add = TRUE)
```

![an_banc_fafb](https://github.com/natverse/bancr/blob/main/inst/images/an_banc_fafb.png?raw=true)

an_banc_fafb

We can do the same with the *Hemibrain*.

We need to load a new R package first.

``` r

if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('natverse/hemibrainr')

library(hemibrainr)
```

And now we can get the equivalent *Hemibrain* neuron.

``` r

# Read hemibrain neuron
hb.an1 <- "706176085"

Now we see all related neurons from three data sets in one space.
Awesome!

We can also see the difference between the Elastix registration and the
`Morpho` based on.

You will first need to download and install Elastix. To do so, you can
follow the instructions
[here](https://elastix.dev/download/elastix-5.1.0-manual.pdf). Remember
that the Elastix binaries must be on your `PATH` and your system must be
able to see its libraries. On MacOSX it is tricky to just install and
use the [Elastix binaries
directly](https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/releases), you need
instead to compile ITK then Elastix yourself.

``` r

# Transform with Elastix
an1.mesh.simp.brain.jrc2018f.elastix <- banc_to_JRC2018F(an1.mesh.simp.brain,
                                                  method = "elastix",
                                                  banc.units = "nm")

# Plot in JRC2018 space
nopen3d()
plot3d(JRC2018F.surf, col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.1)
plot3d(an1.mesh.simp.brain.jrc2018f, col = "blue", alpha = 0.75, add = TRUE)
plot3d(an1.mesh.simp.brain.jrc2018f.elastix, col = "green", alpha = 0.75, add = TRUE)
```

### Get neurons connectivity

``` r

an.upstream <- banc_partner_summary(an1.ids, partners = "input")
an.downstream <- banc_partner_summary(an1.ids, partners = "output")

# Combine the two data frames and add a source column
combined_data <- bind_rows(
  mutate(an.upstream, source = "Upstream"),
  mutate(an.downstream, source = "Downstream")
) %>%
dplyr::filter(weight>2)

# Create the histogram
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = weight, fill = source)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Upstream" = "skyblue", "Downstream" = "orange")) +
  labs(title = "histogram of weights: upstream vs downstream",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Frequency",
       fill = "Source") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```
